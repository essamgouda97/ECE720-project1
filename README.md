# Mosquito Classification and Regression

Using the dataset from both:
  - City of Edmonton (mosquito data): https://data.edmonton.ca/Environmental-Services/Mosquito-Trap-Data/dg7f-ubac
  - Edmonton weather data: https://www.kaggle.com/amit321/edmonton-weather-data

Both a classification task and regression task to predict the gender of the mosquito and count of mosquitos respectively were implemented. The full code could be seen in both notebooks.
